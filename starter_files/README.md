#  Project 2 - Creating and Consuming an Azure Auto ML experiment

*TODO:* Write an overview to your project.

This project encompases most common steps in creating Azure Auto ML experiment and consuming it. Two approaches are used, the first showing how the whole process is performed using Azure ML Studio and the second is using Python Azure SDK. The first approach is regarded as low-code-no-code experience and the second is demonstrating how the same scenario can be accompliched through coding in Python SDK for Azure ML.

Despite small differences, both approaches have the same steps:

- Authentication, to use Azure ML resources,
- Creating Automated ML Experiment, with result of generating Auto ML model,
- Deploying the best model created during Auto ML Experimetn Run,
- Enabling logging to be used for monitoring, performance improvements and debugging
- Consuming deployed models' endpoints and utilizing Swagger tool, and
- Creating and publishing pipeline.

For the purpose of training the model, public data set "Bank Marketing" was used. This dataset was provided as URI containing csv file with records of data colected during direct marketing phone campaigns of banking inistitution. We were required to use Auto ML feature of Azure ML. Auto ML Instead of focusing on selecting and 


## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step.

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps. 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
