The dataset contains 1599 records of eleven red wine physicochemical properties and one output variable 'quality' as sensory data denoting perceived quality of wine according to human taste. Quality is scored from 0 to 10, latest denoting the highest quality. Classes are not balanced and there are more 'ordinary' wines than high or poor quality ones (P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis., Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009.). The data can be used both for regression and classification machine learning tasks.\n",
